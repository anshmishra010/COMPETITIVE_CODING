/*
There are N events in Geek's city. You are given two arrays start[] and end[] denoting starting and ending day 
of the events respectively. Event i starts at start[i] and ends at end[i].
You can attend an event i at any day d between start[i] and end[i] 
(start[i] â‰¤ d â‰¤ end[i]). But you can attend only one event in a day.
Find the maximum number of events you can attend.
